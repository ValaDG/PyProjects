**Greetings and welcome to this simple project**

This is a project created while taking a Udacity course.

The purpose of this project is to leverage the python standard library to create a dynamic site from server side code. Data has been hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

- To regenerate the html page, run python entertainment_center.py
- If the Html file is present, simply double click on it to open it in the file explorer

It will launch the main html containing the movies.
